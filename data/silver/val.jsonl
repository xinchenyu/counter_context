It does have a bias on our opinions and what we will choose in a certain situation.   Bad shit happens to good people, and kids are the easiest victims. I'm sorry that happened to you. Frankly I'd fucking kill someone that I caught raping underage kids.   Though I do give people kinda a gray area on that topic. Like what if she/he was 17 and lied to you on tinder?  Excusable.   But  when you are paying their meth head mom  to rape the 10 year old  child then hack said child up, and throw in a ditch.  Not so much."}

Intentionally taking advantage of someone in an altered state (regardless of the gender of the victim or \"perpetrator\") is wrong. I have refused to have sex with women that were drunk. The only exception being my wife when we were out at a casino or vacation. Some might argue she didn't Consent but she wasn't unconscious and rarely refuses advances when she is sober unless she is very tired or ill. However, I 100% agree that people should take responsibility for their actions and monitor their intake of drugs and alcohol, and be aware of who they are with and where they are going. Regret is not rape. "}
