Rereading it now, I'm realizing a bit how absurd that mindset is.   Men should be allowed to decide if they want a child during the first trimester. This would legally bind them to supporting the child if they said they wanted it. If they say they don't want it, it still allows the woman to have the child or not have the child, simply with the knowledge that they will be a single parent. I think that remains reasonably fair, despite the fact that it will not allow men to have a kid the woman wants to abort. I think it would be unreasonable for a woman to be forced to take a child to term they did not want to. "}

We report on our Dutch research on affirmative action among urban police involving almost 100 intensive individual interviews in yoked sets of three--the minority officer, her or his White co-workers, and their immediate supervisor. Based on this initial, rough comparison, we tentatively advance that contrasting national racial normative structures make critical differences in the reception of the policy.  > jesus fuck how dense are you people.

My point was more so related to the backlash of suing them/the company. Sure, you can sue again for mistreatment, but do you really want to work at a place that hates you? Now you have to find a new job with the tag of \"I sued my old boss, because I didn't like how I was being treated.\""}

I recall seeing some surveys that were done in Sudan in the 1970s about fathers' and husbands' attitudes towards FGM.  It turns-out that fathers, overwhelmingly, didn't want it done to their daughters and husbands, overwhelmingly, didn't want a wife who had had it done to them. So the cutting of girls' genitals in Sudan is done over the objections of *both* fathers and husbands. It is nearly a 100% female-run project, done by older women on younger women.  And feminists blame men for it anyway because, when in doubt, blame men."}
